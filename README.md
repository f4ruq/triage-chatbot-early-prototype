This project is a prototype of an AI-based chatbot designed to assist in medical triage by analyzing patient-reported symptoms using natural language input.

The chatbot aims to:

Collect symptom descriptions from patients.

Predict possible medical conditions.

Estimate urgency levels to support healthcare professionals.

It's intended as part of a larger hospital triage system but can function independently for early testing and development.

This is a preliminary prototype.
